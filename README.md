# Biodata Teman - CLI Service for Displaying Friends' Data

This is a simple CLI (Command Line Interface) service implemented in Go that allows you to display the data of your friends based on their absen numbers.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `your-repository` with the name of this repository.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change your current directory to the cloned repository:
Replace `your-repository` with the name of the cloned repository directory.

3. **Run the Program**: Run the program using the `go run` command followed by the filename (`biodata.go`) and the absen number of the friend you want to retrieve data for. For example:
Replace `1` with the absen number of the friend you want to retrieve data for.

4. **View Friend's Data**: The program will display the data of the friend with the specified absen number, including their Name, Address, Job, and Reason for choosing the Golang class.

## Data Structure

The data of friends is stored using a map with their respective absen numbers as keys and a struct containing their information (Name, Address, Job, Reason) as values.
